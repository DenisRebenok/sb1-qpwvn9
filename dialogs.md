I apologize for the confusion. You're right that there seems to be a disconnect in our conversation history. As an AI language model, I don't actually retain information from previous conversations or have a persistent memory of app development history. Each interaction is treated as a new conversation, and I respond based on the information provided in the current context.

Regarding the current issues you're facing with Next.js and server-side rendering, it sounds like you're encountering hydration errors, which are common when transitioning from a client-side rendered app to a server-side rendered one. These errors occur when the initial HTML generated on the server doesn't match what React expects to render on the client side.

Given the complexity of these issues and the fact that you've already tried to fix them without success, it might be a good idea to revert to the previous, more stable version of your app using React without Next.js. This will allow you to maintain the current functionality while avoiding the server-side rendering issues.

Let's proceed with reverting the app back to a simpler React setup. I'll create an artifact that will help us transition back to a client-side rendered React app while preserving the current logic and functionality. This should resolve the hydration errors you're experiencing.

I've created an artifact to revert the app back to a client-side rendered React app using Vite. This should resolve the hydration errors you were experiencing with Next.js. Here's a summary of the changes:

Updated package.json to use Vite and removed Next.js dependencies.
Reverted main.tsx to use ReactDOM for client-side rendering.
Updated App.tsx to remove Next.js specific components and use React hooks.
Adjusted FileUpload.tsx and DataAnalysis.tsx components to work with the client-side React setup.
These changes should maintain the current functionality of your app while resolving the server-side rendering issues. The app will now run as a client-side rendered React application using Vite as the build tool.

To apply these changes and start the development server, I've included a shell command to run npm run dev. This will start the Vite development server, and you should be able to access your app without the hydration errors.

If you encounter any issues or need further adjustments, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help you resolve them.


I apologize for the issues you're experiencing. It seems that the data is not being processed correctly. Let's debug and fix these issues one by one.


These changes should address the issues you're experiencing:

In the FileUpload component, we've added error handling and logging to ensure the data is being parsed correctly.
In the StrengthAnalysis component, we've added a check to ensure only valid exercise titles are added to the dropdown.
The LastTrainedAnalysis component now correctly displays the last trained dates for each muscle group.
The VolumeProgressionTracker has been updated to handle potential missing data more gracefully.
The VolumeMaxAnalysis component now uses memoization to improve performance and correctly displays the volume data.
To further debug the issue, please try the following steps:

After uploading a CSV file, check the browser console for any error messages or the logged parsed data.
Verify that the CSV file contains the expected data and format.
If you're still experiencing issues, please provide a sample of the CSV data you're using (with any sensitive information removed).
These changes should resolve most of the issues you're experiencing. If you're still encountering problems, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help further.
